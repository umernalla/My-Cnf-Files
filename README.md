# My-Cnf-Files
cnf files for my Testing with RTC article 

These are the CNF files referred to in my article [Testing Real-time Streaming applications with Docker & Refinitiv Real-Time Connector](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/testing-real-time-apps-with-docker-and-real-time-connector)

Use the **vanilla** version if you plan to work through the article and apply the changes I detail in the article.
However, if you just want to skip that - use the **my-rtc.cnf** - and just add your credentials as detailed in the article.

**NOTE**:Just to be clear, whichever file you use will have to be renamed to **rtc.cnf**
